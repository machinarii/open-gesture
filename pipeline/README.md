# Synthetic Data Pipeline

Generates training data for an on-device gesture classifier from the Open
Gesture manifest. The target runtime is **landmark-sequence classification**:
at inference time, `RGB → MediaPipe Holistic → landmarks → temporal classifier`.
The pipeline produces synthetic landmark sequences with matching labels so the
classifier never needs real labeled footage.

## Stage order

                              SMPL-X avatars perform each motion spec.
                              Randomize: lighting, background, distance,
                              angle, occlusion. Output: RGB video.

                              (outdoor / industrial / AR-context variants).

                              Extract landmark sequences — SAME path as real
                              inference. Attach labels via label_schema.json.

## Why Cosmos runs *before* MediaPipe

The original sketch put MediaPipe before Cosmos. That wastes the augmentation:
the classifier trains on **landmarks**, which are largely appearance-invariant,
so photorealism applied *after* extraction never reaches the model.

Where photorealism actually matters is **MediaPipe's own reliability** —
MediaPipe Holistic was trained on real footage and can emit garbage landmarks on
raw Blender renders (plasticky skin, uncanny hands). Running Cosmos first closes
the sim-to-real gap at the point where it bites: landmark *accuracy*. So the
real-world domain variation (outdoor/industrial/AR) is baked in *before*
extraction, and the landmark sequences the classifier sees are both realistic
and correctly detected.

## Open design questions (see repo discussion)

- **Motion authoring is the gating task.** The manifest describes end poses, not
  motion. `motion_specs/*.json` are seeded stubs (heuristic `dynamic` flag,
  empty `smplx_pose` keyframes) — a human or motion-synthesis step must fill the
  SMPL-X poses. 28/99 gestures are flagged dynamic; review the flag before
  authoring.
- **PA, not PAD.** The manifest has valence + arousal but no dominance, so the
  affective heads are two, not three. Add a `dominance` field upstream to get
  the full PAD model.
- **Hailo-8L may be overkill.** A temporal classifier over landmark *vectors*
  (1D-CNN / TCN / GRU) is tiny — the runtime cost is MediaPipe on the host CPU,
  not the classifier. Confirm Hailo is buying anything before targeting it. Note
  Hailo runs HEF, not TFLite directly: TFLite/ONNX → Dataflow Compiler → HEF.

## Tools

| Script | Input | Output | Notes |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| `export_labels.py` | `manifest.json` | `labels/` | Deterministic class↔index maps. Re-run after any manifest change. |
| `generate_motion_specs.py` | `manifest.json` | `motion_specs/` | Skips existing files (won't clobber hand-authored specs); `--force` to regenerate. |

Both are stdlib-only Python 3. Run from this directory:

```bash
python3 export_labels.py
python3 generate_motion_specs.py
```
